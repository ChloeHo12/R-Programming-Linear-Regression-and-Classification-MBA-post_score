From the logistic regression results, it can be noticed that some variables (Age_in_years, Percentage_in_12_Class) are not statistically significant. Keeping them in the model may contribute to overfitting. Therefore, they should be eliminated. This can be done automatically using statistical techniques, selecting an optimal model with a reduced set of variables, without compromising the model accuracy.","metadata":{"_uuid":"ee2d87fc-9eb3-4672-94d4-cac6ce132ddb","_cell_guid":"06d198d7-9879-41c1-a439-22face6222fb","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"admission_log <- glm(Performance~pre_score + Percentage_in_10_Class + Percentage_in_Under_Graduate + percentage_MBA, trainingset, family = \"binomial\")\nsummary(admission_log)","metadata":{"_uuid":"37443a45-92a9-4e3b-8f63-88b1e9abf430","_cell_guid":"9a5d092d-ca21-4ede-87e1-add02d7694d8","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-10T06:49:54.054826Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-10T06:49:54.056189Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-10T06:49:54.078109Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Making predictions**\n\nI will make predictions using the validation data set in order to evaluate the performance of my logistic regression model. \nTo do this, I will follow the procedure:\n*   Predict the probabilities of getting high MBA performance\n*   Predict the class of individuals","metadata":{"_uuid":"d4ff86d2-ef35-4ac9-be18-fb0b87d2b429","_cell_guid":"fb226446-e674-48c4-809f-e645b7dab3cc","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Predict the probabilities of getting high MBA performance","metadata":{"_uuid":"b455355e-1300-4892-b11c-f63ea72b6f3f","_cell_guid":"d01c06a0-1a09-4d24-87ff-7d44c5dd9e31","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Predict the probabilities of getting high MBA performance\nadmission_log_pred <- predict(admission_log, validationset, type = \"response\")\nhead(admission_log_pred)","metadata":{"_uuid":"c8f3bdd7-66fe-439b-a00f-e0f74aeff7fb","_cell_guid":"8b9bcbd6-cc3e-42b9-9ad3-2301eb1b3a92","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-10T06:49:54.080451Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-10T06:49:54.081797Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-10T06:49:54.101552Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":43,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The output is the probability that the MBA performance will be good.
