Introduction\n\nMBA is the common abbreviation for a Master of Business Administration degree. An MBA is a common stepping stone to C-suite positions in large businesses, as well as provides aspiring entrepreneurs a springboard to success. This project analyzes how a person’s MBA post-score is influenced by lower-level performances and demographics. The potential predictors are Gender, Marital Status, Demographics, Performances in lower-level study, Under-graduate Specialization.","metadata":{"_uuid":"051d70d956493feee0c6d64651c6a088724dca2a","_execution_state":"idle"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# read csv file\nadmissions <- read.csv(\"../input/others/MBA_ADMISSIONS.csv\")\nhead(admissions)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-10T01:38:02.716205Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-10T01:38:02.717905Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-10T01:38:02.758650Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" ***1.1 Basic Visualization***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Bar charts showing the distribution of Age, Gender&Marital Status\nbarplot(table(admissions$Age), ylim = c(0,170), main = 'Distribution of Age', ylab = \"Percentage\", xlab = \"Age in years\", cex.lab = 1.2, cex.name = 1,xlim = c(0,10), cex.axis = 1.2, beside = TRUE, col = c(10,11))\nbarplot(table(admissions$Gender, admission$Marital_status), ylim = c(0,300), main = 'Distribution of Marital Status and Gender', ylab = \"Percentage\", xlab = \"Count\", cex.lab = 1.2, cex.name = 1, xlim = c(0,10), cex.axis = 1.2, legend = TRUE, beside = TRUE, col = c(10,11))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-10T01:38:05.456455Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-10T01:38:05.457998Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-10T01:38:05.599703Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Figure 1: Upper: Distribution of Age, Lower: Distribution of gender and Marital Status\n\nFigure 1 shows that most MBA learners are around 22 years old and single.
