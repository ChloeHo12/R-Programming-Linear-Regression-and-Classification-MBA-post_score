# Linear Regression and Classification to predict MBA post-scores

This repository contains the code and data for the MBA Performance Analysis project. The project aims to analyze the factors influencing MBA post-scores and predict the likelihood of achieving a successful MBA performance.

## 1. Project Overview
The project consists of the following components:
- Exploratory Analysis: The initial phase involves conducting exploratory analysis to uncover the distribution of demographics among MBA applicants. Variables such as age, gender, and education will be analyzed to gain insights into the applicant pool.
- Clustering: The project utilizes k-means clustering to identify patterns and group applicants based on their demographic characteristics. This analysis provides a deeper understanding of different applicant segments within the MBA program.
- Regression Analysis: Linear regression techniques are employed to predict the post-score of MBA applications. This helps in understanding the relationship between various factors and the overall performance of MBA students.
- Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used to model the probability of achieving a high or low MBA performance. By considering relevant predictors, such as demographics and application data, the model provides insights into the likelihood of success in the program.

## 2. Results
The project's findings and insights are documented in the project report, available at Report.ipynb. The report summarizes the exploratory analysis, clustering results, and regression analyses, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing MBA post-scores and the probability of achieving a successful MBA performance.
